## MERCS

Essentially, this work is an extension of the MERCS-framework, which is then applied to the problem of making predictions while missing values are present in your data. 

The MERCS package (with the extensions as described in this work already integrated!) can be found [here](https://github.com/eliavw/mercs)

## Experiments
